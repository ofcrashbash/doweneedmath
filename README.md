## Setup build engine

Currently I am using HUGO. Cos it is very fast and interactive.

#### Linux

On Linux the easiest way to install it is by running
>sudo apt install hugo

#### Windows

The easiest way is to use [__chocolatey__](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager
> choco install hugo

## Building

After setup from root folder just run:

>hugo server -D

## Deploying

Can be done by running script *deploy.ps1*
*okmechak-github-io* is submodule which contains final site
